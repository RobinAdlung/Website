		<h1>Data protection</h1>
		<h2>General information and mandatory information</h2>
		<h3>Designation of the responsible body</h3>

		<p>The responsible body for data processing on this website is:</p>
		<p>	
		<img class="contact-data" id="contact-data" src="adress.png" alt="contact-data">
		<script>
			$('contact-data').mousedown(function (e) {
  				if(e.button == 2) { // right click
    			return false; // do nothing!
				}
			}</script>
		</p>
		<p>The responsible body, alone or together with others, decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, contact details, etc.).</p>

		<h3>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h3>

<p>Some data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time. An informal notification by email is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

		<h3>Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority</h3>

<p>As the person concerned, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the responsible supervisory authority in the event of a breach of data protection law. The responsible supervisory authority for data protection issues is the state data protection officer of the state in which our headquarters are located. The following link provides a list of data protection officers and their contact details:</p> 
<p class="link">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.</p>

	<h3>Right to data portability</h3>

<p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to third parties. It is provided in a machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another person responsible, this will only take place if it is technically feasible.</p>

	<h3>Right to information, correction, blocking, deletion</h3>

<p>You have the right to free information about your stored personal data, origin of the data, its recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary, the right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data at any time within the scope of the applicable legal provisions. You can contact us at any time using the contact options listed in the imprint if you have any further questions about personal data.</p>

	<h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>

<p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the site operator, our website uses an SSL or. TLS encryption. This means that data that you transmit via this website cannot be read by third parties. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the "https: //" address line of your browser and by the lock symbol in the browser line.</p>

	<h3>contact form</h3>

<p>Data transmitted via the contact form, including your contact details, will be stored in order to process your request or to be available for follow-up questions. This data will not be passed on without your consent.</p>

<p>The data entered in the contact form will only be processed on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can withdraw your consent at any time. An informal notification by email is sufficient for the revocation. The legality of the data processing operations carried out before the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<p>Data transmitted via the contact form will remain with us until you request deletion, revoke your consent to storage or there is no longer any need for data storage. Mandatory legal provisions - especially retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>

	<h3>YouTube</h3>

<p>Our website uses plugins from YouTube for the integration and display of video content. The provider of the video portal is YouTube, LLC, 901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.</p>

<p>When calling up a page with an integrated YouTube plugin, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. This tells YouTube which of our pages you have visited.</p>

<p>YouTube can assign your surfing behavior directly to your personal profile if you are logged into your YouTube account. You can prevent this by logging out beforehand.</p>

<p>YouTube is used in the interest of an attractive presentation of our online offers. This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

<p>You can find details on handling user data in YouTube's data protection declaration at:</p> 
<p class="link">https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy.</p>

	<h3>Google Web Fonts</h3>

<p>Our website uses web fonts from Google. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>

<p>Through the use of these web fonts, it will be possible for you to present our website as desired, regardless of which fonts are available locally. 
This is done by accessing the Google Web Fonts from a Google server in the USA and the associated transfer of your data to Google. This is your IP address and which page you have visited. Google Web Fonts are used on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR. As the operator of this website, we have a legitimate interest in the optimal presentation and transmission of our website.</p>

<p>The company Google is certified for the US-European data protection convention "Privacy Shield". This data protection agreement is intended to ensure compliance with the data protection level applicable in the EU.</p>
